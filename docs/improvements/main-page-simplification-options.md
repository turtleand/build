# Main Page Simplification Options

Goal: reduce visual clutter from the current three stacked sections while keeping discovery, search, and featured content easy to access.

## Option 1: Hero + Single Feed
- Replace the three sections with one continuous feed.
- Top hero: one featured post, short subtitle, and a primary CTA (e.g., "Start here").
- Inline search bar sits above the feed, minimal chrome.
- Use a list layout (small thumbnail + title + meta) instead of card grid.

Why it helps: users see one clear content stream, with search as a lightweight control rather than a full section.

## Option 2: Spotlight + Two Tabs
- Keep one wide featured spotlight card at the top.
- Below, a simple tab switch: "All posts" | "Search".
- Search tab shows only input and results; default tab is clean.
- Cards are lighter (no heavy shadows, smaller tag pills).

Why it helps: reduces vertical stacking and makes search appear only when needed.

## Option 3: Search-First with Deferred Feed
- Center the search input as the primary interaction.
- Featured posts appear as 1-2 small chips below the search bar.
- The full feed appears only after a query or a "Browse all" button click.
- Optional empty-state illustration to guide first-time users.

Why it helps: limits on-screen content and focuses attention on a single action.

## Option 4: Editorial Grid with Shared Controls
- Remove section headers; use one editorial grid.
- First row uses larger cards (featured), remaining grid is standard size.
- A slim control row (search + tags) sits above the grid.
- Consistent card style across all items.

Why it helps: one visual system replaces three, and hierarchy comes from size not extra sections.
